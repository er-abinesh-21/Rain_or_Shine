## 🎯 How It Works

1. **User Input**: The app provides an input field for users to enter a city name.
2. **API Call**: Upon submission, the app sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API using the Fetch API or Axios to retrieve weather data for the specified city.
3. **Dynamic Rendering**: The received weather data is dynamically rendered on the web page, including temperature, weather description, and an icon.
4. **Responsive Design**: CSS media queries ensure the app looks great across devices of different screen sizes.
